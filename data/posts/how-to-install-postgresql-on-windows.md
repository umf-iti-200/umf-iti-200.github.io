Type the password for your database. For now, you can just type `postgres` in both text fields. In production, **never** use this password. Choose a strong one. After that, click on "Next".

Done. The entire process should be completed and you have installed both PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4 in the same process.

If you would like to install only the pgAdmin 4, I recommend you to follow [this tutorial](/posts/how-to-install-pgadmin-4-on-windows).
