# Introduction

First, you have to open the project on Visual Studio Code (VS Code). You should search for the "File" menu and then "Open Folder...". Please don't select "Open.." This will open a single file. You should open the entire project (entire folder).

If everything goes well, you should be able to see on VS Code the entire folder

Go back to the menu bar, search for "View" and then click on "Terminal".

This will open a built-in terminal on VS Code. The good thing is that the terminal is opened in the project folder. That is, you don't need to navigate to that folder. You are ready to launch your project.

Just type `node server.js`. You should be able now to see your project running in the browser.
