On this page, you will learn how to sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS) if you don't have any account yet.

# Getting Started

To create a new AWS account, open your browser and access <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com</a>.

Search at the top right-hand corner for <em>Sign In to the Console</em> and click on it.

On the next page, at the bottom, you will find a button to create a new account. Click on it:</p>

Now you need to type the email for the root user (in this case, it will be yourself. You may use your umich.edu account) and an account name (you may change it later). Once you typed all the information, press <em>Verify email address</em>.

AWS will send an email with a 6-digit verification code to confirm you have access to the provided email. This code is valid for 10 minutes. Copy this code and paste it in the text field and then press <em>Verify</em>:

If the information provided is correct, you will start a 5-step procedure before finishing your account creation.

## Step 1: Create Password:

In this step, you need to type your password and then press the <em>Continue</em> button.

## Step 2: Add Contact Information

Select <em>Personal</em> as you will learn how to use this service. If you are creating an account for your future company/startup, you should select <em>Business</em>.

Add all information about yourself and don't forget to click on <em>I have read and agree to the terms of use</em> before pressing the <em>Continue</em> button.

## Step 3: Add Billing Information

Add all information related to billing. As AWS states, you can't proceed with the sign-up process until you add a valid payment method.

<div class="alert alert-primary">
    AWS <strong>will not charge</strong> you for usage below AWS Free Tier limits. They may temporarily hold up to $1 (or an equivalent amount in local currency) as a pending transaction for 3-5 days to verify your identity.
</div>

## Step 4: Verify your phone number

In this step, AWS will ask you to confirm your phone number by using a PIN.

## Step 5: Choose your plan

In this step, select the AWS Free Tier. If everything goes well, your account will be activated within a few minutes. However, AWS says that the process can take up to 24 hours.

Once your account is fully activated, you will receive a confirmation email. Don't forget to check your spam folder for the confirmation email.
