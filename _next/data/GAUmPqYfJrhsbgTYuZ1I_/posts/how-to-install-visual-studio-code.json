This tool is free, open source, and can be installed in popular Operating Systems such as Windows, Linux, and MacOS. If you would like to know more about it, please access <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">their website</a>.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to install it on your computer. Please read the section related to the operating system you are using.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installing-on-macos\">Installing On MacOS</h2>\n<p>Access <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>, click on the blue arrow facing down and then select the \"stable\" version.</p>\n<p><img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"mac-1.png\"></p>\n<p>Your browser will download a <code>.zip</code> file. Open the Finder to see it. MacOS might automatically unzip it into a <code>.app</code> file, as you can see in the image below. Just drag and drop this icon to a folder called <code>Application</code> usually located in the left sidebar.</p>\n<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"mac-2.png\"></p>\n<p>Click on the Application icon in the dock bar, search for the Visual Studio Code, and open it!</p>\n<p><img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"mac-4.png\"></p>\n<p>Because you are opening this app for the first time (and you did not download it from the Mac App Store), MacOS will ask if you trust it. Just Press \"Open\".</p>\n<p><img width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"mac-5.png\"></p>\n<p>Congratulations. You have installed VS Code on your machine.
