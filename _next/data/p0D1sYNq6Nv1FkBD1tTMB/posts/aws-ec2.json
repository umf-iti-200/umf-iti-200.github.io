{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)","author":"Thiago Ferreira","category":"Amazon AWS","tags":["aws","amazon","ec2"],"id":"aws-ec2","content":"<h1 id=\"beforeyoubegin\">Before You Begin</h1>\n<p>If you did not create yet an AWS account, please follow <a href=\"../amazon-aws/create-a-new-aws-account.html\">this tutorial</a>. If you already have an account, just sign in to Console.</p>\n<h2 id=\"createanec2server\">Create an EC2 Server</h2>\n<p>On your Console Home, look for <code>Services</code> on the top navbar and then go to <code>Compute → EC2</code>.</p>\n<p><img  src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224560899-a2534981-9fcb-46c7-98ff-5d8c6c07eadf.png\"></p>\n<p>Amazon EC2 offers the broadest and deepest <strong>computing platform</strong>, with over 500 instances and a choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model to help you best match the needs of your workload.</p>\n<p>When you access EC2, the image below shows its homepage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224561673-c1280961-d58c-4422-9aab-df733bef2ba5.png\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, the figure shows 0 instances running. To make it clearer, suppose that an instance is a computer running in the cloud (or just a \"virtual computer\"). If you would like to create a new instance, on the homepage, search for <em>Launch Instance</em>. You are going to answer several questions while setting up a new instance.</p>\n<p><img width=\"250\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224561798-4642b88d-911d-4aea-a386-0d0862978e92.png\"></p>\n<p>The first information is the name of your instance.</p>\n<p><img width=\"250\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224561921-222fc68d-d4d7-4b30-a37c-fcc245554f7a.png\"></p>\n<p>For this lesson, just type <code>backend-server</code>. However, you may pick another name based on your preference.</p>\n<p>The second step is to select the <em>Application and OS images</em>. In this one, you will set which Operating System are you planning to use. Because we want to use the free tier of Amazon AWS, it is important to keep the 'default' settings as stated in the image below. Anything other than that can cost you extra money.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224562139-dd5292db-4e34-4e97-a364-1097445489fb.png\"></p>\n<p>The next type is the <em>Instance Type</em>. Here you are going to select how \"powerful\" the instance is. Again, we want to be under the free tier. So, select <code>t2.micro</code>. As you can see, this machine has only 1 vCPU (or Virtual CPU) and 1 GiB as RAM. This is sufficient for this class. Again, avoid selecting other types. It will cost you extra money.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224562246-ef58a892-f151-487c-94c7-cc7850cd0d61.png\"></p>\n<p>The next step is the <em>Key pair (login)</em>. Once you have your instances ready and running, you will need this information to access them because AWS EC2 uses SSH to access instances. So, let's create a new key pair.</p>\n<p><img  src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224562538-e3f6d78d-43ba-4597-a713-dc72d9c6c92d.png\"></p>\n<p>A dialog window will open. Just type a name for your key pair and keep the remaining options set as default. As a suggestion for this class, just type your first name. Press <em>Create a key pair</em>.</p>\n<p><img width=\"250\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224562656-efaf808f-83e5-4cf6-927f-ab6ee344e35c.png\"></p>\n<p>If everything goes well, you will be asked to download a file <code>&amp;lt;YOUR_NAME&amp;gt;.pem</code> and then you should see the key pair you have just created as selected.</p>\n<p><img width=\"250\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224562750-f071b083-c902-44b2-adc0-ecd912c5c978.png\"></p>\n<p>The next step is to select <em>Network Type</em>. You will choose the type of traffic your \"virtual laptop\" will allow from the outside. Just for this course, select HTTPS and HTTP. In a real or production environment, I would recommend you select only HTTPS.</p>\n<p><img width=\"250\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224562920-4fcb6d3c-b942-41a1-ad3f-5f10f2ea6b51.png\"></p>\n<p>For <em>Configure Storage</em>, just keep the default option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224563093-dc514bf5-8f18-45f4-a8a9-f3f50bd22a54.png\"></p>\n<p>That's it. You did all the basic settings for your instance. On the right side, you can see a summary of all options you have selected so far. Just click on <em>Launch instance</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224563217-757ae920-3c37-447c-9aa4-29b1c80bdd6e.png\"></p>\n<p>If you go back to the EC2's homepage, you have now 1 instance running.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224563311-67081102-f124-45ad-bed4-1c681b8d94ed.png\"></p>\n<p>If you click on it, you can see that your instance is now running.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224563325-6aad312f-d839-448e-9c63-2a8ead202b8b.png\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"accessingyourinstance\">Accessing Your Instance</h1>\n<h2 id=\"linuxandmac\">Linux and Mac</h2>\n<p>If you are using Linux or Mac, you need to change the permissions on your key pair file by typing the following command:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    chmod 400 &amp;lt;key_pair_file&amp;gt;.pem\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don't forget to change <code>&amp;lt;key_pair_file&amp;gt;.pem</code>. If you don’t change the permission, the key pair is considered <em>too permissive</em>, or unsafe, because it is ostensibly readable by other users and then you won't be able to SSH into the EC2 instance as a result. Now you only need to follow the same steps for <a href=\"#windows\">Windows</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"windows\">Windows</h2>\n<p>Open the Terminal/Console, navigate to the folder that has your <code>.pem</code> file and then type:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    ssh -i &amp;lt;key_pair_file&amp;gt;.pem ec2-user@&amp;lt;public_ip_from_dashboard&amp;gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You need to replace <code>public_ip_from_dashboard</code>. On your EC2 dashboard, select the instance you have just created.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224564789-f0f3b12b-2a52-4439-b437-7bfeca32779e.png\"></p>\n<p>Look for \"Public IPv4 address\". This is the IP you will need to access your instance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224564855-2837c819-4fa1-4cad-82ad-99e996d09cd0.png\"></p>\n<div className=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\n    Use this IP <strong>only</strong> for SSH.\n</div>\n<p>Now it is time to access your instance. On the terminal, type again the aforementioned command with the correct IP.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224565060-bd94d7d9-c36c-42fc-9096-6c20450242fb.png\"></p>\n<p>Congratulations! Now you are accessing the instance you have just created! At this point, your terminal is now interacting directly with your EC2 instance (aka your \"virtual computer\") - <strong>rather than your physical machine</strong>.</p>\n<div className=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\n    The next commands will be executed in your instance, so keep the terminal open.\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"updateallpackages\">Update All Packages</h1>\n<p>Because you have just created your instance, it is a good practice to upgrade all packages to the newest versions. Thus, type in the terminal to elevate your privileges:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    sudo su\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then type:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    yum update -y\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: if you are familiar with using <strong>homebrew</strong> on your Mac, you can think of the way we are using yum here as similar to <strong>brew</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installnodejs\">Install Node.js</h2>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>this link</span></a> for more information. In summary, type the following commands in the terminal:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will download the installer. Then type the following:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh\n</code></pre>\n<p>To execute the installer. Finally:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    nvm install 16\n</code></pre>\n<p>To install Node.js 16x. Amazon Linux 2 (the free-tier Operating System you selected) does not currently support the current LTS release (version <code>18.x</code>) of Node.js. We should use Node.js version <code>16.x</code>. If you would like to install the most recent version, you should pick another Operating System.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourfirstnodejsapplicationonec2\">Your First Node.js application on EC2</h2>\n<p>Now it is time to run your first application on EC2 by using the content from GitHub. If you don't have an account yet, please <a href=\"https://github.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\"><span>create one</span></a>.</p>\n<p>Because your instance does not have Git installed, you need to install it:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    yum install git\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Before installing any new tool/package, please make sure you are \"root\". If you are not, type <code>sudo su</code> in the terminal/console.</p>\n<p>Confirming by typing \"y\" in the following prompt:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224567199-68fa3f02-7fd9-4d5c-9386-f6e5fd9a9107.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-12 at 3 10 41 PM\"></p>\n<p>Now type the following command to clone the source on it:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    git clone https://github.com/umf-iti-200/amazon-ec2.git\n</code></pre>\n<p>If everything went well, you are supposed to see the folder downloaded on your instance. Just type <code>ls</code>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224567311-63f5756f-2eed-46f1-b258-dce61cfce900.png\"></p>\n<p>Open the folder by typing:</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    cd amazon-ec2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you can install all dependencies</p>\n<pre><code className=\"shell language-shell\">\n    npm install\n</code></pre>\n<p>and, finally, you can run your application in the cloud:</p>\n<pre><code>\n    node server.js\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224567576-21e31cd2-c4bc-457d-97a3-79f24d2a65a8.png\"></p>\n<p>Congratulations! Your app is now running in the cloud! Let's see it in action!</p>\n<h1 id=\"visualizingyourserver\">Visualizing Your Server</h1>\n<p>Open your EC2 dashboard on your browser. Select the instance you created earlier and search for Public IPv4 DNS (as in the image below). This is the URL the users will access your server (Don't share the IP since it can change constantly).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224567914-3a952e18-dcc0-49df-8a2e-3cefe1b268cb.png\"></p>\n<p>Open your browser and type it:</p>\n<pre><code>\n    http://&amp;lt;SERVER_URL&amp;gt;:3000\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Don't forget the PORT <code>3000</code> and <code>http://</code>. What happened? Exactly! Nothing. Although your server is running.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224569241-2926d039-a2c3-4d6d-9433-1004d65e4b63.png\"></p>\n<p>The problem is that your browser cannot reach your server (virtual computer) because you haven't configured the Security Group to allow inbound rules for HTTP/HTTPS on your instance. By default, only the SSH port was allowed (Port 22).</p>\n<h1 id=\"allowpublicaccess\">Allow Public Access</h1>\n<p>Go back again to the EC2 dashboard, select your instance and then open the <em>Security tab</em> at the bottom. On <em>Security groups</em>, you will see what is the security group attached to your instance. Click on it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224569595-1e13939a-6e09-40cc-95f9-9668f3acc428.png\"></p>\n<p>Now you have access to set all <em>inbound</em> and <em>outbound</em> rules for this specific security group. Select the <em>Inbound Rules</em> tab and then <em>Edit Inbound rules</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224569693-adf571bc-ed48-43be-89d1-d3ebfe9d1f7d.png\"></p>\n<p>Click on Add Rules and then type/select the following settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type:</strong> Custom TCP</li>\n<li><strong>Port Range:</strong> 3000</li>\n<li><strong>Source:</strong> Anywhere IPv4</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, Click on <em>Save rules</em>. You should come up with something similar to the image below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224569912-1e6a7300-50f8-4c5c-a144-4745f2a866c9.png\"></p>\n<p>Go back to your browser and refresh the website. Guess what? Now you should be able to see your server running!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114015/224570097-9bdd6898-f751-44d7-8a20-7564006c8ba9.png\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"cleanup\">Clean Up</h1>\n<p>Navigate to your EC2 dashboard (where you can see the list of all your instances).
